# Librarius
A home-library inventory and shelving utility app

## UX Case...
Under construction...

##Features/Technologies Used
1. UITabView (UIKit)
2. ISBN/Barcode Scanner (AVFoundation, MTBScanner pod)
3. Google API Client (AFNetworking/Google API/Google iOS SDK)
4. Persistent Book Collections (Core Data, Fetched Results Controller)

##TODO:
* Scanning batches: a "History" tableview like Amazon's. 
* Arranged Book Collections (sort of the point of the app) use a Custom CollectionView Layout.
  * Switch between organization schemes: Library of Congress, Subject Headings, or Dewey Decimal System. 
* Polish the UI:
  * Use my newfound Sketch skills to import a cool UI template.
  * Ideally, get it to look like a bookcase.
